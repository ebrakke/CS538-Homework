\section*{Answer 1}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] First, let's assume we have an experiment where $D$ sends two messages $m_0,m_1$ and gets back an encryption of one of these messages where $b$ is chosen at random.  $b$ is the message that is encrypted.\\
We know that $\Pr[\text{D outputs b} | exp-b] = 1/2 + neg$\\
That is, $D$ does not have any advantage by seeing $(y,d)$ in choosing $b$\\
Let's assume this is not the case\\
Given a $y_b,d_b$ from $m_b$ where $m_b$ is one of $m_0,m_1$ chosen by $D$, $\Pr[\text{D outputs b}|exp-b] = 1/2 + \epsilon$ Where $\epsilon$ is some non-negligible probability\\
This means that $D$ is able to distinguish $(y_0,d_0)$ from $(y_1,d_1)$ with some non-negligible advantage $\epsilon$\\
Let the event $E$ be the event that $D$ queries $H$ on $r = f^{-1}(y)$
If $\bar{E}$, then that means $D$ never asked for $H(r)$.\\
Because $d_0$ is just $p \oplus m$, and $p$ is $H(r)$, $D$ needs to know $H(r)$ to have any kind of advantage on distinguishing\\
Thus, if $\bar{E}$, then $D$ does not have any advantage on distinguishing regardless of $b$\\
Because he has no advantage, then $Pr[\text{Guessing correctly} | \bar{E}] = 1/2$
If we let $S$ be the event that $D$ guesses $b$ correctly, we have $\Pr[S] = \Pr[S|E]\Pr[E] + \Pr[S|\bar{E}]\Pr[\bar{E}]$\\
We know that $Pr[S] = 1/2 + \epsilon$\\
$1/2 + \epsilon = \Pr[S|E]\Pr[E] + 1/2(1 - \Pr[E])$\\
$1/2 + \epsilon = \Pr[E] + 1/2 - \Pr[E]/2$ (Because if $E$, then $D$ will distinguish)\\
$2*\epsilon \le \Pr[E]$

	\item[(b)] Let's use $D$ to build a function $R$ that can reverse the OWF $f$\\
We will give $R$ the inputs $PK, y$ and will expect that $R$ can use $D$ to output $f^{-1}(y)$ with non-negligible probability\\
$F$ will then ask $q_{hash}$ queries to $H$ and $q_{enc}$ queries to $Enc(m)$ and distinguish between them\\
We can assume that $F$ will query $H$ for $H(a_j)$ before asking for $Enc(m_j)$ because without the hash information, he cannot tell anything about the response he will get\\
We can also assume that before generating $m_0,m_1$ $F$ will ask $H$ for the hash of two number $r_0,r_1 \in D_i$ because $F$ will need this info to distinguish the output of $Enc$\\
$R$ must create $H(a_j)$ as such:\\
If $a_j$ has been queried before, then output the same value $s_j$.  If not then output a random $s \in D_i$ and store the value\\
$R$ must create $Enc(m_j)$ in the following way:\\
Find $a_j, s_j$ and output $(f_i(a_j), s_j \oplus m_j)$ where $f$ is the OWF\\
When $D$ is ready to guess, he will send $Enc(m_0)$ and $Enc(m_1)$\\
$R$ will return $(y, H(r_0) \oplus m_0)$\\
If $D$ returns $0$, then $R$ can output $r_0$ as the inverse of $y$, else abort\\
This gives $R$ a probability of $\epsilon$ chance of inverting $y$\\
This is because we know that there is a non-negligible chance that $D$ has to ask $H(r)$ where $r = f^{-1}(y)$\\
Therefore, if we choose $m_0$ to be the message we encrypt and send $y$ to $D$ along with $H(r) \oplus m_0$, and $F$ says that this message is $m_0$, then that means that $D$ was able to distinguish this because $r$ was chosen correctly.\\
We know that $D$ has a probability of $\epsilon$ of asking for $r$ by the previous part\\
And now we have a 1/2 chance of choosing the correct $m$ to encrypt.  Therefore $R$ has an $\epsilon / 2$ chance of reverting $f$, which is non-negligible\\
This is a contradiction, because we assumed $f$ was a OWF, therefore this encryption scheme is polynomially secure\\
\qed

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Answer 2}
Given a random oracle $H$ we can construct another random oracle $H'$ to hash to arbitrary lengths by doing the following:\\
$h_1 = H(n || s)$\\
$h_2 = H(n || h_1)$\\
...\\
$h_i = H(n || h_{i-1})$\\
Then you have $h = h_1||h_2||...||h_i$ and output $n$ bits $h_1...h_n$\\
In this case $i = \lceil n/l \rceil$\\
The outputs will always be independent of eachother because either $s$ will be different or $n$ will be different  between two pains $(n,s)$\\
Because we take $H(n||s)$ first, we are guarenteed that this will be unique (i.e. no collisions with greater than negligible probability)\\
This means that $h_2...h_i$ will also be unique, so concatonating them together will give us indepent outputs
